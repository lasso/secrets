# secrets

A small demo application written in Crystal. This application will be used to introduce the
Crystal language to internal developers at an upcomping event.

## Installation

No dependencies apart from the standard lib, so no shard installations neccessary.

## Usage

`shards run` will execute the program. At the moment there are no choices involved. The program will simply create a text file named "secrets.txt" in the current folder, write encrypted data to it and read it back. 

## Development

This application is only made for educational purposes and I don't expect to develop it (much) further. It is licenced under the MIT licence though, so feel free to fork it if you find it usable. I will not accept PRs against this project.

## Contributing
